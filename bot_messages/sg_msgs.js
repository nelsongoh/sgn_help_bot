  SHN_MSG: "Some freqently asked questions:\n\n" +

  "1) I am returning to Singapore after 9 April, 2359hrs. Am I allowed to make separate arrangements if I do not " +
  "want to stay in the Government-provided dedicated SHN hotels?\n\n" +

  "All returnees to Singapore are required to serve their 14-day SHN in the dedicated hotels. This is to ensure that " +
  "proper and timely medical care can be provided to you if needed and it will also help minimize the risk of " +
  "spread to others. For those with extenuating circumstances, such as medical conditions or mobility issues, " +
  "please provide the details in this form at www.go.gov.sg/shnhotelneeds. They can also contact the SHN Helpline " +
  "at +65 6812 5555 for more information.\n\n" +

  "2) How can I calculate my total SHN-stay period? \n\n" +

  "The Ministry of Manpower has provided a SHN / LOA calculator for you to verify your total length of stay required " +
  "during this period. Please check it at: https://service2.mom.gov.sg/shn/shn-calculator/" +

  "3) Am I supposed to be contacted by the authorities to verify my location during the SHN?\n\n" +

  "During this period, the authorities may contact you via Whatsapp or pay you a physical visit to ensure that " +
  "you are keeping to the SHN / LOA rules. Based on community answers, some forms of contact may include having " +
  "the hotel staff check up on you on behalf of the authorities instead.\n\n" +

  "4) Can I have food / items that I need, delivered to me during the stay?\n\n" +

  "Yes you may - Food delivery services and / or family members may leave their items at the reception, and the " +
  "hotel staff will deliver it to your room.\n\n" +

    "1) Deliver essential goods or services\n\n" +
    "2) Provide assistance to a senior (60 years old and above) or an individual with physical or mental disability\n\n" +
    "3) Seek or render help in an emergency",

    "situations where you come into closer proximity with other people, such as at wet markets, supermarkets or " +
