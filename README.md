# SGN Help Bot

## What is this bot about? Yet another Telegram bot? (Backstory and intro)
In light of the recent COVID-19 pandemic, thousand of Singaporeans abroad have been, and are still seeking, avenues of help to either try and return back home, or find local Singaporean communities in their respective countries for support. During this time, I'm one of these thousands of Singaporeans abroad, currently pursuing my Masters in Sydney, Australia. As part of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' outreach to us in an email, we were provided with a Telegram group chat support link to support us during this time which is proudly managed by the Singapore Global Network (SGN).

The SGN (https://www.singaporeglobalnetwork.com/) is a Singapore government organization that has quickly put together resources to help support these fellow Singaporeans, both within and outside of the country, by helping to plan and orchestrate part of the Singapore COVID-19 response effort. During this time, there were officials from SGN helping to answer queries, liaise with the authorities, and one large problem, was the need for repeated answers to questions raised by newer members of the group. Hence, I decided to volunteer my time to mitigate some of these problems via a Telegram bot.

This bot was hacked together as quickly as I could have (which explains the horrible project structure), based on whatever time I had to help support the SGN Telegram group chats, by providing readily-available information in the form of quick links, to thousands of Singaporean group chat members.

## What is this bot made with? Where is it hosted?
This bot was created with simple Javascript, using a wrapper library (node-telegram-bot-api) and hosted on Google Cloud.
